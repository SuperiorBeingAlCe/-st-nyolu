Our Rules
If you want to contribute to this project, you’ll follow the rules, no exceptions.
Here, there’s no room for amateurism, ego wars, or nonsense.
Quality, logic, discipline — that's the only language spoken here.

# 1. Communication Style
No ad hominem (personal attacks), ideas are debated, not people.

Drop the "I feel like" nonsense, bring evidence and logic.

This isn't about emotions, it's about absolute reason.

# 2. Code Standards
Write clean, readable, and documented code.

Naming conventions must be meaningful and consistent.

Add sufficient tests for every new feature. Without tests, your code is garbage.

PR descriptions must be clear and to the point.

# 3. Reporting Bugs
When reporting bugs:

Provide a detailed description.

Clearly explain how to reproduce it step by step.

Include screenshots or example code if necessary.

# 4. Feature Proposals
Before saying "Let's add this feature," ask yourself:

What problem will this solve?

How does this align with the project's vision?

Is it really needed, or just another fluff?
If you can't answer these three, don’t even bother.

# 5. Contribution Process
Open an issue → discuss → get approval.

Submit a PR → keep changes focused and small → write a clear description.

Be open to feedback during code review. Don't get defensive, improve.

# 6. Acceptance and Rejection
Project maintainers:

Will evaluate contributions based on objective quality standards.

May reject contributions without explanation if deemed unfit.

Will make final decisions in non-negotiable matters.

Here, quality is non-negotiable.
Follow the discipline, or take your ideas elsewhere.

# 7. Our Philosophy
"The path to truth is carved by the sword of logic."
In this project, there's no room for emotional outbursts or ego displays.
Only producers, improvers, and intellectual warriors belong here.
